While I can't say it's helped with fine line and wrinkles, this product, paired with my volition moisturizer really helped with the dry areas on my face. However, I cannot use this serum (or any serum or moisturizer for that matter) on its own and have to pair with a moisturizer. I switched to the rose deep hydration moisturizer and the combo just didn't work for me as I still felt dry/tightness around my chin area.

I received this in my Allure box and checked the ingredients on it right away. I have sensitive skin, so I am limited to what I can use and you would not believe how many skin care companies put chemicals and cheap junk into. I was surprised by the ingredients list! It is all amazing ingredients! It contains some that I have never tried before. I cleansed my face, toned and applied this before my moisturizer. It sinks deeply into my pores and does NOT leave any residue behind! It also did not break me out AT ALL. It's actually feels therapeutic to use, in my opinion. Now if I don't use it in conjunction with my moisturizer, my face feels very tight and a little dry. I love this essence and I plan to buy a full size bottle when I run out of this one!!

4264,828,110.0,Dhampir,5,"This peel gel seriously saved me. My whole life I had the worst oily, yet dry and very flaky skin. I would always have noticeable flakes on my nose and forehead area. NOTHING helped it. I mean, I didn't really invest in skin care and I would try to go for the more affordable âamazingâ products. But now I'm glad I made the choice to seriously invest. Everything I picked out, I did so much research on (who wants to waste money when they're buying a whole skincare routine at once.) and I don't regret any of it. ESPECIALLY this one! I will address the issues I see in some reviews: Yes, this is hard to wash off. But it's worth it. I'm not sure if it actually gets clumped in peach fuzz, I purposely got a little in my eyebrow and scalp to test it out and it didn't cling to little hairs at all. I seriously observed all of the action as I've used this the past couple weeks and from what I can see, I've come to the conclusion that this product actually clumps up in my dead skin, which is actually a good thing because it shows that it's really clinging to it and doing great with removing it. So that whole debate on if the little clumps are dead skin or the product itself? I think it's both. So, remember I said how my skin was this gross oily flaky texture? Nothing would help it. It got to the point where I was willing to use a washcloth to try and rub the flakes off and id scrub it pretty hard. I was so sick of my skin that I was willing to damage it. Which still didn't even help. No exfoliation's, toners, face cleansers, nothing. The very first night I used this, the amount of clumps that I saw was insane! (they reduced over time as my skin came to life)But what was even more shocking was that once I rinsed this off, literally ALL of my oiliness, dryness, and flakiness instantly vanished. My skin immediately became baby smooth. It was actually emotional for me because it was the best my skin has ever looked in my life. My skin never gets annoyingly flaky now.

6813,1986,183.0,MamaBare27,2,"This stuff is a major disappointment so far. The reviews are all super, but the serum is not. For the very high price of a one ounce bottle, I expected at least some results after a few weeks. No miracles, of course, but something? Anything? I always regret straying from my standard Caudalie/PTR regimen. This serum is sticky, and stays that way. All day or night, STICKY. I live near a large, polluted city on the East Coast, so with Dior's magical claims of detoxifying and protecting skin from âexternal aggressors' like pollution, I at least expected a very clean feeling to my skin. But in the several weeks that I used it two times daily, my skin got noticeably worse! I am over 50 but have pretty good skin. Just fighting the age, with fine lines, larger pores, and a bit of leftover sun damage. But when I used the Dior serum, my skin actually broke out with cheek acne. Haven't seen that in 40 years! I flipped my vanity mirror to Magnify, and was dismayed to see that it looked like my skin was sort of disintegrating. THAT has never happened to me. I guess fear of aging will make you do stupid things like pay $100 for one ounce of something you haven't sampled before. It makes me feel even worse that this is sort of a pre-serum serum...it was almost bound to fail. Once again, I kept the faith and kept using it to give it a chance, so now I likely can't return it. (I gave this 2 stars strictly for the excellent packaging. Dark, heavy glass bottle; nice smooth-action pump; secure lid.) When an expensive, designer skincare product makes your skin worse than it's ever been, you know it is definitely not the ONE.

I believe it is a very concentrated product of glycolic acid then sodium hydroxide. I m guessing that the amount of sodium hydroxide might have assisted the action of glycolic acid, hence making this product more effective than others I have used. that said, Sunday Riley sulfur mask is still more effective for acne treatment. this would be more for regular maintenance.

503,5652,32.0,momneedscoffee,5,"After being introduced to a soothing mist that my esthetic nurse friend gave me a sample of, I wrestled within myself on whether or not I should incorporate something like that in my skincare routine. Also, I remember years ago that an esthetician I knew years ago would use one of Dermalogica's additives (I think it was the Clearing Additive) in my treatments and I loved it. Before using the soothing mist, I wouldn't even give any consideration about buying something like this as I would have deemed it as unnecessary. Also, the Dermalogica Additive provided one of the best experiences I've had during a facial (other than the pops, of course). So, after using mostly fragrance-free or no-added fragrance products in my skincare routine (as well as my husband complaining that some of the products did have an aversive scent. I don't blame him as I felt the same way), I found myself missing that sensory element of smelling spa-like aromas. Also, I consider my skincare routine to be a slice of time that I have for myself. Ultimately, I bought a bottle of this stuff as it turned out to be gentle on my skin (I made sure to test it out first by spritzing it each time I went to a Sephora), which is great because it does list ""parfum"" as part of its ingredients. Also, the sprayer produces very fine mists that feels like a true moisture boost (kind of like a light humidifier feeling) as opposed to a feeling like small drops landed on my skin & falling down on my face like tears. I don't find myself fanning my face after using this. The elements of a great spray mechanism, soothing to my face, & the spa-like sensory experience are the top reasons why I decided to buy this. The fact that it can be easily purchased at popular store like Sephora is an added bonus. Is this product ""extra""? Perhaps. However, I do find the sensory experiences of things, especially something I do every single day, important as it does give me a sense of calm, as well as provide nice added moisture.

Dab on the cream. It heats up in contact with the water. 4. Screw on the white/blue cap. 5. Rub the ridged end of the cap onto the area with some pressure. 6. Rinse off and apply toner / continue your routine. **The instructions say to put the cream on first and then water because if you're not careful, it will slide off, so you can also do cream first and then water. This is just my preference to feel more of the heat.** I use it 3-4 times per week, and a bottle lasts for a few months. I notice that the creases in my nose are clearer, but I still have daily sebum issues. So, this doesn't solve the problem, just halves it. Overall, I recommend it.

I have always liked using an acne/ oil control face wash in the AM but my current one contained salicylic acid which is not safe to use during pregnancy. I talked to my doctor about pregnancy safe alternatives and did lots of online research which led me to this product. Not only is it pregnancy safe but it is probably the most effective acne cleanser I have ever used! I have far fewer breakouts even with my hormones going crazy from pregnancy and it does wonders for keeping shine at bay in my t-zone while not over drying the rest of my face. I should mentioned I have combo skin and tend to have a very oily t-zone but normal-dry cheeks. I only use this is the AM followed by a vitamin c serum and moisturizer. It has a bit of a sulfur smell but hey what do you expect from a cleanser that has sulfur as an active ingredient? The smell doesn't linger on your face but can linger on your device if you use one to wash your face. I use the FOREO Luna 3 and have to make sure I rinse all the cleanser out after each wash to keep the smell away. This is definitely a product I will continue to buy even after I can use salicylic acid again, it is just so good!

Then I wet the soap and rub all over my face. I create a lather and massage for a minute or two. When rinsing it's important to do the splashing technique for 30 splashes with the treatment water (oil and soap water) and then 10 splashes of running hot water. I then follow up with the light controlling lotion (which seems like it would dry your skin but doesn't). After that I put on the hydra serum and then night cream. This routine morning and night along with monthly facials with steam and extraction, as well as a healthy diet has really helped me out.

12091,9298,1092.0,Agnes,5,"A friend recommended this to me when she heard me complaining about struggling to find a cleanser that doesn't dry out my already dry skin. This product is brilliant as it cleanses and removes all make-up, particularly eye make-up, with minimal effort. It's gentle on the skin and it doesn't burn your eyes. I love that I don't need an additional step to remove my makeup. I have tried and thrown out many cleansers over the years. It is on the pricey side for a cleanser but a little goes a long way. So glad I was recommended this - my favourite cleanser ever!",,0,1,0,0,0,No data,No data,No data,No data,Cleanser,19.0

It could just be the more regular skin routine and the other products I've started to use but it could be the product too. Needless to say, even though I'm happy with this product, and I'm not allergic, I really don't like the smell enough.I will use the product simply because it's not causing allergies but I won't buy it again.This will not become one of my new staples.",,0,0,0,0,0,No data,No data,No data,No data,Toner,7.95
